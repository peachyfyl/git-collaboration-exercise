flew in by miami beach buse
didn't get to bed last night
on our way the paper back was on my knee
man I had a dreadful flight

Im back in the USSR
you don't know how lucky you are, boy
back in the USSR

 been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
leave it to tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone

Im back in the USSR
you don't know how lucky you are, boy
back in the US, back in the US, back in the USSR

The Ukraine girls really knock me out
they leave the west behind
and Moscow girls make me sing and shout
and Georgia's always on my mind

Back in the USSR
you don't know how lucky you are, Boy
back in the USSR

The Ukraine girls really knock me out
they leave the west behind
and Moscow girls make me sing and shout
and Georgia's always on my mind
Back in the USSR

Oooh, Show me round the sloping mountains way down south
take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your bella like his ringing hub
come and keep your comrades warm

Back in the USSR
you don't know how lucky you are, Boy
back in the USSR
