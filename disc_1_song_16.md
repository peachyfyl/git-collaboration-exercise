I will

who knows how long I've loved you
you know I love you still
will I live a lonely lifetime
if you want me to I will

for if I ever saw you
I did not catch you name
but it never really matter
I will always feel the same

love you for ever and forever
love you with all my heart
love you whenever were together
love you when were appart

and when atlast I find you
your song will fill the air
sing it loud so I can hear you
make it easy to be near you

for the things you do indeed
you do me. -ah you know I will

i wiiiiiiiilllll
hmmmmm hmmm hmmm la la la laaaaa
