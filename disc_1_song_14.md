I listen for your footsteps
coming off the drive
listen for your footsteps
but they don't arrive 

waiting for your knock, dear
on my awful door
don't hear it doesn't mean you don't love me anymore

I hear the clock is ticking 
on the metal shelf 
see the hands are moving 
but I'm by myself
I'm wondering where you are tonight and why I'm by myself 
Don't see you doesn't mean you don't love me anymore 

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
cause you know darling, I love, oh, you
you'd never know it'd hurt me so but I'll hate to see you go 
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
you were in a car crash and you lost your hair 
you said that you would be late about an hour or two 
but that's alright, I'm waiting here, waiting to hear from you 

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
cause you know darling, I love, oh, you
you'd never know it'd hurt me so but I'll hate to see you go 
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
cause you know darling, I love, oh, you
you'd never know it'd hurt me so but I'll hate to see you go 
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry
