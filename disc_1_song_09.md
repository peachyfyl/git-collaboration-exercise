Martha my dear
Martha my dear
Though I spend my days in conversations
but please remember me
martha my love don't forget me
martha my dear
hold your head up you silly girl
look what you've done
when you find yourself in the *uninteligible*
help yourself to a better world that is all around you
silly girl
take a good look around you
take a good look
you're about to see that you and me
were meant to be with each other
silly girl
hold your head up you silly girl
see what you've done
when you find yourself in the *uninteligible*
help yourself to a better world that is all around you
silly girl
martha my dear you've always been my inspiration
and please be good to me
martha my love don't forget me
martha my dear
