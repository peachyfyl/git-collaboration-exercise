Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt????????? (mood)
and for all the little piggies life is getting worse!!!!!!!!
always having dirt to play around in

have you seen the bigger piggies in the starched white sheds
you will fine the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
always have clean shirts to play around with

instrumental!!!!!!

in their skytes with all their backing they don't care what goes on around!!!
in their eyes there's something lacking what they need's a damn good whacking

mad instrumental!!!!!!very intense!!

everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggies lives
you can see them out for dinner with their piggie wives
clutching forks and knives to EAT THEIR BACON
one more time

violins and pigs!!
