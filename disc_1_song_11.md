 Blackbird singing in the dead of night
 take these broken wings and learn to fly
 all your life
 you were only waiting for this moment to arrive

 Blackbird singing in the dead of night
 take these sunken eyes and learn to see
 all your life
 you were only waiting for this moment to be free

 blackbird fly-
 blackbird fly-
 into the light of the dark black night

 blackbird fly-
 blackbird fly-
 into the light of the dark black night

 Blackbird singing in the dead of night
 take these broken wings and learn to fly
 all your life
 you were only waiting for this moment to arrive

 you were only waiting for this moment to arrive
 you were only waiting for this moment to arrive-
