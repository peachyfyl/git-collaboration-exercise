i look at you all, see the love that is sleeping, while my guitar gently weeps, look at the floor and I see it needs weeping, still my guitar gently weeps, i dont know why nobody told you, how to unfold your love, i dont know how someone controlled you, ... bought and sold you, i look at the world and i know it is turning, while my guitar gently weeps, every mistake we must surely be learning, still my guitar gently weeps, i dont know how you were diverting, you were perverting too, i dont know how you were inverted, no one alerted you, i look at you all, see the love that was sleeping, while my guitar gently weeps, look at you all, still my guitar gently weeps
