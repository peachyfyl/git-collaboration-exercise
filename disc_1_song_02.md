Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
the sun is up, the sky is blue,
it's beautiful and so are you.
Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play.

Dear Prudence, open up your hands
Dear Prudence, see the sun and sky
the wind is low, the birds will see
that you are part of everything.

Dear Prudence, won't you open up your eyes
look around, -round, -round, -round
look around, -round, -round, -round
look around

Dear Prudence, let me see you smile
Dear Prudence, like a little child
the clouds will be, the days are changed,
so let me see your smile again
Dear Prudence, won't you let me see your smile.

Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
the sun is up, the sky is blue,
it's beautiful and so are you.
Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play.
