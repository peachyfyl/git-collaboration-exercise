Half of What I say is meaningless, but I say it just to reach you Julia, Julia, Julia.
Oh sweet child, calls me,
so I sing the song of love, Julia, Julia
Seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me,
so I sing the song of love, Julia.
The hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering in the sun.
Julia, julia, morning moon, touch me
so I sing the song of love, Julia
when I cannot sing my heart I can only speak my mind
Julia, Julia.
Sleep in sand, silent cloud, touch me
so I sing a song of love, Julia, calls me,
so I sing the song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia
