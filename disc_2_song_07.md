Its been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you, when I loved you?
Take a long, long, long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
How I love you
So many tears I was searching, so many tears I was wasting, ohh ohhhhhhh
Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever, misplace you?
How I want you, oh I love you
You know that I need you, oh I love you
